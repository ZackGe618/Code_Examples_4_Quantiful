    "  - 支持 begin_date, end_date, q(搜索词), page(翻页,单次只能返回10条结果)\n",
    "  - 返回的结果为 json 类型, 包括 Article ID, Artcile URL, Headline, Keyword, Authors 等信息\n",
    "- 通过关键字 Covid-19, coronavirus, vaccine 分别调用 nyt_api, 取回结果, python 代码为 nytimes_search_api.py\n",
    "- 对 api 返回的三个关键字的结果, 利用 Article ID 去重, Covid-19(1667), coronavirus(1849), vaccine(362), 最后得到 1956 篇文章, 保存为 articles_nytimes_opinion.csv 和 articles_nytimes_opinion.meta, meta是json格式, 方便后续使用. python 代码为 parse_api_data.py\n",
    "- 利用整理好的 Article 信息, 抓取 html 页面整体文本并保存, 方便后续解析, 每篇文章一个html文件, 文件名用 Article ID 命名. python 代码为 get_html.py\n",
    "- 依次解析html文本, 利用 xpath 解析html中文章主体部分, 解析时注意保留文章分段信息, 去掉 nytimes 末尾信息(与内容无关), 并利用 nltk 对 Tokenizer 做了处理, 生成语料库的文本文件, 文件名为 [pub_date] [no] [headline] [authers].txt, 并统计corpus的word_count, 保存到 word_count.csv中, python 代码为 parse_html.py\n",
    "- 解析中发现, 有文本词数为0的, 确认后发现为全图片文章, 过滤掉, 最终文章数 1873, words 数量 188w+, 整理文章meta信息并保存到 corpus_meta.csv 中"

Others spread conspiracies claiming the virus was sent by Westerners or suggested it was all a hoax.

It’s happening to me and all Italians. Beginning in the north, where I live, and now in the whole country. Everything is shut: no schools, no meetings, no parties, no movies, no plays, no sporting events. No bars and no restaurants. No shops open, except food stores and pharmacies.

But that support evaporated when it was made clear that any such overhaul would involve abolishing the private insurance market. At the time, nearly 160 million Americans received their health benefits through an employer, and the vast majority of them liked that coverage just fine — maybe not enough to sing about it, but enough to be wary of a potential replacement. & The New York Times & Jeneen Interlandi                       & https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-medicare-for-all.html              & subject: Health Insurance and Managed Care,subject: Labor and Jobs,subject: Medicine and Health,subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: United States Economy,subject: Unemployment,glocations: United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 2053 &  216 & data\\_html/fafdf61b-5dd4-5f9c-9b7b-a720a322c538.html & -430\\\\\n",

In Conakry, Guinea’s capital city, an imam was arrested for violating his quarantine, and residents protested by not letting health officials check for fevers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The New York Times | Charlie Warzel                                 | https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/opinion/coronavirus-health-experts.html            | subject: Coronavirus Risks and Safety Concerns,subject: Masks,subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: Quarantines,subject: Medicine and Health,subject: Social Media,persons: Fauci, Anthony S,persons: Trump, Donald J                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2187 |   59 | data_html/8003e25d-8526-5aa6-a130-d7a65fa83886.html | 123 |\n",

Just “Stay at home.” It’s painful for me and all Italians. | CREMA, Italy — An open society in lockdown: It’s almost an oxymoron, a mind game. Until it happens, and life suddenly changes. It’s happening to me and all Italians. Beginning in the north, where I live, and now in the whole country. Everything is shut: no schools, no meetings, no parties, no movies, no plays, no sporting events. No bars and no restaurants. No shops open, except food stores and pharmacies. Across the country, as of Thursday, 15,113 people have contracted the virus (about half are in hospital); 1,016 have died and 1,258 have recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The New York Times | Beppe Severgnini                               | https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/opinion/italy-coronavirus-shut-down.html           | subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: Senses and Sensation,subject: Travel and Vacations,subject: Hospitals,subject: Workplace Hazards and Violations,subject: Epidemics,subject: Quarantines,organizations: Corriere della Sera,organizations: Serie A (Italian Soccer League),organizations: WhatsApp Inc,glocations: Italy,glocations: Lombardy (Italy),glocations: Milan (Italy),glocations: Codogno (Italy),glocations: Bergamo (Italy),glocations: Europe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 1256 | 1638 | data_html/d912bc40-5d3b-580e-a73a-154ab38cb589.html | 123 |\n",

But the pandemic is getting in the way.               | When I began reporting this article, before the pandemic, it was about an ingenious solution to a huge but hard-to-see problem: In many poor countries, most people get their grain from mom-and-pop local mills. But these mills don’t fortify their flour with the basic nutrients that children (and others) need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The New York Times | Tina Rosenberg                                 | https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/opinion/coronavirus-africa-malnutrition.html       | subject: Vitamins,subject: Grain,subject: Iron (Nutrient),subject: Flour,subject: Shutdowns (Institutional),subject: Malnutrition,subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: Ventilators (Medical),subject: Children and Childhood,subject: Diet and Nutrition,subject: Small Business,subject: Spina Bifida,subject: Iodine,subject: Food,subject: Medical Devices,subject: Coronavirus Reopenings,subject: Masks,subject: Vitamin B12,organizations: Project Healthy Children,organizations: Stanford University,organizations: United States Agency for International Development,organizations: World Food Program,organizations: British Broadcasting Corp,persons: Magufuli, John (1959- ),glocations: AFRICA,glocations: Dar es Salaam (Tanzania),glocations: France,glocations: Geneva (Switzerland),glocations: Germany | 1410 |  439 | data_html/b06034cf-1bba-5333-a58a-3ff685f3ec50.html | 119 |\n",

It is the longest stretch of river in Texas north of the Rio Grande. As we rode along the rim of the bluff, Lemuel Brown pointed out a clearing in the tangle of mesquite and red cedar where the tawny river reveals itself in the gully below. There once were a lot of marriage proposals here, he said, especially at sundown, when the water gleams like molten brass.

She calls me Sobchak, as in Walter Sobchak, John Goodman’s character in the film “The Big Lebowski,” the veteran who equates everything with Vietnam. My wars were Iraq and Afghanistan, and life during the coronavirus pandemic does keep reminding me of them. The way each day bleeds into the next. The threat that stalks outside. The surrealness of it all. Before heading to the grocery store, as we inspect our masks and lay out sets of rubber gloves, I tell my wife that our meticulous preparation feels like precombat checks before a patrol.

As usual, the electorate was torn and confused. Polling indicated that a small majority of likely voters favored a new universal system that would cover everyone. But that support evaporated when it was made clear that any such overhaul would involve abolishing the private insurance market. At the time, nearly 160 million Americans received their health benefits through an employer, and the vast majority of them liked that coverage just fine — maybe not enough to sing about it, but enough to be wary of a potential replacement. | The New York Times | Jeneen Interlandi                       | https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-medicare-for-all.html              | subject: Health Insurance and Managed Care,subject: Labor and Jobs,subject: Medicine and Health,subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: United States Economy,subject: Unemployment,glocations: United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2053 |  216 | data_html/fafdf61b-5dd4-5f9c-9b7b-a720a322c538.html | -430 |\n",

You can see this most clearly in the South. In Louisiana, blacks account for 70 percent of the deaths but 33 percent of the population. In Alabama, they account for 44 percent of the deaths and 26 percent of the population. South Carolina and Georgia have yet to release information on death disparities, but in both states blacks are more likely to be infected than whites. The pattern exists in the North as well, where African-American populations in cities like Chicago and Milwaukee have high infection and death rates.                                                                  | The New York Times | Jamelle Bouie                           | https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-racism-african-americans.html      | subject: Race and Ethnicity,subject: Black People,subject: Blacks,subject: Discrimination,subject: United States Economy,subject: Labor and Jobs,subject: Whites,subject: Income Inequality,subject: Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),subject: Minorities,persons: Katznelson, Ira,subject: Deaths (Fatalities)                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1894 | 1075 | data_html/1c09c431-28f6-526d-87b5-80ce7c724af0.html | -448 |\n",

Families began buying goods such as convenience foods, vacuum cleaners and microwaves to substitute for women’s unpaid labor at home.

As usual, the electorate was torn and confused. Polling indicated that a small majority of likely voters favored a new universal system that would cover everyone. But that support evaporated when it was made clear that any such overhaul would involve abolishing the private insurance market. At the time, nearly 160 million Americans received their health benefits through an employer, and the vast majority of them liked that coverage just fine — maybe not enough to sing about it, but enough to be wary of a potential replacement.                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1867 We know that Covid-19 is killing African-Americans at greater rates than any other group. You can see this most clearly in the South. In Louisiana, blacks account for 70 percent of the deaths but 33 percent of the population. In Alabama, they account for 44 percent of the deaths and 26 percent of the population. South Carolina and Georgia have yet to release information on death disparities, but in both states blacks are more likely to be infected than whites. The pattern exists in the North as well, where African-American populations in cities like Chicago and Milwaukee have high infection and death rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Families began buying goods such as convenience foods, vacuum cleaners and microwaves to substitute for women’s unpaid labor at home.
